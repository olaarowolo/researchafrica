# Test Report for Admin and User Login & Password Reset Flows

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of full thorough testing performed on the admin and user login and password reset functionalities, including related UI changes and route configurations.

---

## Testing Scope
- Admin login and logout
- Admin password reset request and reset form
- User login and logout
- User password reset request and reset form
- Route accessibility and middleware protections
- UI rendering and form submissions on login and password reset pages

---

## Test Results Summary

### Passed Tests
- Basic unit tests for some models and example tests
- Admin dashboard access
- Some AfriScribe feature tests (landing page, welcome form display, authentication required for admin requests)
- Some quote request tests (form display, validation)

### Failed Tests
- Many unit tests related to AfriScribe models failed due to missing factories or incorrect casts.
- Numerous feature tests for admin functionalities failed with 403 Forbidden or 419 CSRF errors.
- Authentication tests for admin and member login, logout, registration, and password reset mostly failed with 419 errors or route not found.
- Database query exceptions due to missing columns in tables (e.g., `article_categories` missing `name` column).
- Some feature tests failed due to missing model factories.
- Several tests failed due to invalid JSON responses or unexpected HTTP status codes.

---

## Issues Identified
- Missing or misconfigured database migrations leading to missing columns.
- Missing or misconfigured model factories for test data generation.
- CSRF token issues causing 419 errors in POST requests.
- Route naming inconsistencies causing route not found errors.
- Authorization issues causing 403 Forbidden responses.
- Some tests expecting redirects but receiving different status codes.

---

## Recommendations
- Review and fix database migrations to ensure all required columns exist.
- Create or fix model factories for all models used in tests.
- Verify CSRF token handling in tests and forms.
- Confirm route names and middleware configurations are consistent.
- Review authorization policies and middleware to ensure correct access.
- Re-run tests after fixes to verify resolution.

## Next Steps
Please advise if you want me to:
- Assist with fixing the failing tests and issues identified.
- Provide detailed debugging and code fixes for specific failing areas.
- Proceed with finalizing the current task despite test failures.
