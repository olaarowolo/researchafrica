            <strong> Peer Review Process:</strong>
          </h3>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li> Our peer reviewers adhere to the guidelines set by the E Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). </li>
            <li> Once the review is completed, reviewers provide one of the following recommendations to the editor: </li>

                           </h4> 
                           Occasionally, the reviewer may recommend accepting the paper without any changes if it is exceptionally strong and meets all the publication criteria.
                        </li>

                               The most common recommendation is to request revisions, which can be major or minor. Major revisions involve significant changes to the content or methodology, while minor revisions address smaller issues. The editor will provide guidance to the author regarding the necessary modifications.</li>
                           </ul>

                           </h4>
                        If the reviewer suggests that the paper is not suitable for publication in its current form, it may be rejected. However, the final decision ultimately rests with the editor.</ul>
                           </ul>
