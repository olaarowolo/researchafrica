I am unable to run the Laravel tests and fix any errors due to the current environment's command execution restrictions. I cannot execute `phpunit`, `php artisan test`, or any custom PHP scripts.

Therefore, I cannot identify what errors exist or proceed with fixing them. You will need to run the tests manually to identify any issues.
