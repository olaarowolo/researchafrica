# Creating Logins and Assigning Roles for Journal Users on Research Africa

This guide explains how to create login accounts for each journal user (e.g., editors, reviewers, authors) and assign unique roles to them, including the login URL and required details.

## 1. Prerequisites

-   Admin access to the Research Africa platform
-   Journal user details (name, email, role, etc.)

## 2. Creating a User Account

1. Log in as an admin or journal manager.
2. Navigate to **Users** or **Members** in the admin dashboard.
3. Click **Add New User** or **Invite User**.
4. Fill in the required fields:
    - Full Name
    - Email Address (must be unique)
    - Password (or select 'Send Invitation Email' to let the user set their password)
    - Select the Journal the user will be associated with
    - Assign Role(s) (e.g., Editor, Reviewer, Author)
    - Additional details (optional): phone number, department, etc.
5. Click **Save** or **Invite**.

## 3. Assigning Unique Roles

-   During user creation, select one or more roles for the user.
-   Roles can be changed later by editing the user profile.
-   Each user can have different roles for different journals if needed.

## 4. Login URL and Access Details

-   The login page for all users is:

    **Login URL:** `https://researchafrica.org/login`  
    (Replace with your actual deployment URL if different)

-   Users log in with their email address and password.
-   Upon first login, users may be prompted to update their profile or set a new password if invited.

## 5. Managing User Access

-   To update roles or reset passwords, go to the user's profile in the admin dashboard.
-   To deactivate or remove a user, use the **Deactivate** or **Delete** option in their profile.

## 6. Security Recommendations

-   Encourage users to use strong, unique passwords.
-   Enable two-factor authentication if available.
-   Regularly review user roles and permissions for each journal.
