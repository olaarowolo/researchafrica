I have analyzed the files and found that `MemberRoleSeeder.php` already has a duplicate prevention check using `firstOrCreate`. It seems there was a confusion with `MemberTypeSeeder.php`, which did not have this check.

I have now updated `database/seeders/MemberTypeSeeder.php` to include a duplicate prevention check using `updateOrCreate`. This will prevent errors if you run the seeder multiple times.

Here is the content of the updated `database/seeders/MemberTypeSeeder.php`:
```php
<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use App\Models\MemberType;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Database\Console\Seeds\WithoutModelEvents;

class MemberTypeSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     */
    public function run(): void
    {
        $member_type = [
            [
                "id" => 1,
                'name' => 'Author',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
            [
                "id" => 2,
                'name' => 'Editor',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
            [
                "id" => 3,
                'name' => 'Reviewer',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
            [
                "id" => 4,
                'name' => 'User',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
            [
                "id" => 5,
                'name' => 'Publisher',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
            [
                "id" => 6,
                'name' => 'Reviewer 2',
                "status" => 1,
            ],
        ];

        foreach ($member_type as $type) {
            MemberType::updateOrCreate(['id' => $type['id']], $type);
        }
    }
}
```

The `MemberRoleSeeder.php` file remains unchanged as it already correctly handles duplicate entries. Here is its content for your reference:
```php
<?php

namespace Database\Seeders;

use App\Models\MemberRole;
use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
use Illuminate\Database\Console\Seeds\WithoutModelEvents;

class MemberRoleSeeder extends Seeder
{
    /**
     * Run the database seeds.
     */
    public function run(): void
    {

        $memberRoles = [
            ['title' => 'Student', 'status' => 1],
            ['title' => 'Librarian', 'status' => 1],
            ['title' => 'Professor', 'status' => 1],
        ];

        foreach ($memberRoles as $role) {
            MemberRole::firstOrCreate($role);
        }
    }
}
```
