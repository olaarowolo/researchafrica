## Files Modified
- `app/Mail/QuoteRequestClientAcknowledgementMail.php` - Added CC recipient
- `app/Modules/AfriScribe/Http/Controllers/QuoteRequestController.php` - Enabled emails, updated redirect/message, added better error logging, temporarily using log driver, fixed syntax errors, removed invalid class references, added affordable pricing for Research Proposal Review, changed to success page redirect
- `resources/views/afriscribe/partials/as-pr-form.blade.php` - Added "Research Proposal Review" option to both product dropdown and service type dropdown with pricing configuration
- `resources/views/afriscribe/success.blade.php` - Created new success page with countdown timer, loading animation, and redirect functionality

## Current Status
- ✅ All syntax errors and class reference errors fixed
- ✅ Form validation properly implemented
- ✅ **"Research Proposal Review" fully integrated**:
  - Added to product options dropdown
  - Added to service type dropdown with pricing
  - Very affordable pricing configured:
    - UK: £0.015 per word (25% cheaper than proofreading)
    - Nigeria: ₦5,000 flat rate (very affordable)
- ✅ **Success page with countdown implemented**:
  - Beautiful success page with checkmark icon and loading animation
  - 5-second countdown timer with visual feedback
  - Clear message telling user they are being redirected
  - Option to go to home page immediately
- Emails are now configured to be sent to:
  - Admin: researchafripub@gmail.com
  - Client: user's email (with CC to olasunkanmiarowolo@gmail.com)
- Redirect: Now shows success page with countdown before redirecting to `/afriscribe/home`
- Temporary fix: Using 'log' driver to prevent email sending errors. Emails will be logged instead of sent.

## Next Steps
- Test the form submission to verify the success page and countdown work correctly
- Check Laravel logs to see if emails are being generated correctly
- Once mail configuration is fixed, change back from 'log' driver to 'smtp' driver
- Configure proper mail settings in .env file (MAIL_MAILER=smtp, MAIL_HOST, etc.)
