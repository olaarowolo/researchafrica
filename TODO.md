## Next Steps
- **Configure mail settings in .env file** to enable actual email sending:
  - Set `MAIL_MAILER=smtp`
  - Set `MAIL_HOST` (e.g., smtp.gmail.com for Gmail)
  - Set `MAIL_PORT` (e.g., 587 for Gmail)
  - Set `MAIL_USERNAME` (your email address)
  - Set `MAIL_PASSWORD` (your email password or app password)
  - Set `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` (e.g., tls for Gmail)
  - Set `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `MAIL_FROM_NAME`
- Test the form submission to verify both emails are sent correctly
- Check Laravel logs to see if emails are being sent successfully
- Verify that the custom sender names are working properly
