# AfriScribe Route Fix - Completed

## Issue
- 404 error when accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/afriscribe`
- The requested resource `/afriscribe` was not found on the server

## Root Cause
- The `RouteServiceProvider` was attempting to load AfriScribe routes directly
- This conflicted with the proper `AfriScribeServiceProvider` route loading mechanism
- The service provider was already registered in `config/app.php` but the direct loading was interfering

## Solution Applied
- ✅ Removed direct AfriScribe route loading from `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php`
- ✅ Cleared route cache: `php artisan route:clear`
- ✅ Cleared config cache: `php artisan config:clear`
- ✅ Verified route registration: `/afriscribe` now properly routes to `AfriscribeController@welcome`

## Verification
- Route listing confirms: `GET|HEAD afriscribe ....... afriscribe.welcome`
- All AfriScribe routes (11 total) are now properly registered
- The route should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/afriscribe`

## Next Steps
- ✅ Created new modern welcome page: `resources/views/afriscribe/welcome.blade.php`
- ✅ Updated `AfriscribeController@welcome` to use the new view
- ✅ Updated all navigation links to use proper Laravel routes
- Test the route in browser to confirm the new welcome page loads
- If view issues occur, check that `resources/views/afriscribe/welcome.blade.php` exists and is properly configured
